# ToDo-App 📃
## I've written a To-do List application's backend that fulfils the following requirements -

- User authentication using JWT and cookies 🔐
- A todo endpoint which can add, delete, update and list all todos for a specific user 📝
- Todo endpoint will be only for signed in users 🧑

For further details, keep scrolling 😉

(Skip to the end of the repository to know how to test it yourself.)

## Tech Stack ⚙️
- NodeJS and ExpressJS 
- PostgreSQL 
- Redis

## Test the working:
Since, the application is deployed on Heroku, you need not clone the repository and try running it on your local system. If you do so, please make appropriate changes in the database details for both Postgres and Redis, in the **/config/index.js** file.

- I've created a public Postman <a href="https://www.postman.com/saksham-chaturvedi/workspace/to-do-app-backend">workspace</a> that contains URLs to all the above mentioned endpoints. <br><br>

## Follow the below mentioned steps to checkout the working of the APIs:
### STEP 1:
- Fork the collection to your Postman workspace. <br><br>

### STEP 2:
- Provide a label to the forked project. <br><br>

### STEP 3:
- Now you can test all the endpoints by sending appropriate requests, without any hassle. If you do send any request incorrectly, the response message shall guide you the correct way. <br><br>
